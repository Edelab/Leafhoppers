# Leafhoppers
These codes support the manuscript "Can leafhoppers help us trace the impact of climate change on agriculture?" from Plante et al. 2023. This study was conducted in seven strawberry fields distributed in four geographic regions in the province of Quebec, Canada: Captitale-Nationale, Chaudiere-Appalaches, Mauricie and Monteregie, during the growing seasons from 2020 to 2023. In this study, we investigated:
-	Leafhopper abundance and diversity (R codes : Analysis of biodiversity indices.R + Data : vegan)
-	Population distribution and influence of temperature (R codes : Empoasca fabae - Modeling leafhopper abundance (temperature only).R ; Macrosteles -  Modeling leafhopper abundance (temperature only).R ; Modeling leafhopper abundance (temperature + rain).R ; Modeling leafhopper abundance (temperature only).R + Data : populations)
-	SbGP phytoplasma and disease incidence 
-	Leafhopper microbiome
-	Ineffectiveness of insecticides to control leafhoppers (R code : Impact of insecticide treatments on leafhopper abundance + Data : insecticides)
